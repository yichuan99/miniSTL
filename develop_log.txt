What you did:
Implemented 80% of iterator base class
----------------------------------------------------------------------
What you learned:
	partial template specialization:
		Partial template specialization is a particular form of class template specialization. Usually used in reference to the C++ programming language, it allows the programmer to specialize only some arguments of a class template, as opposed to explicit specialization, where all the template arguments are provided.

	iterator traits:
		Traits class defining properties of iterators.

		Standard algorithms determine certain properties of the iterators passed to them and the range they represent by using the members of the corresponding iterator_traits instantiation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------	
What's next:
Finish iterator base class implementation
Write vector/list class

What you did:
implemented the basic version of allocator (based on "new")

What you learned:
What's allocator
What's a trivial destructor
What's dynamic cast/static cast

What's next:
More tests
Comparison between homebrew allocator and standard allocator (who's faster)
Implement vector

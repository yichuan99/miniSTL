This is a simplified version of C++ STL implementation. 

Four major components:
Container
Iterator
Algorithm
Function

Container:

	Simple:
		pair
		tuple

	Sequence:
		array
		vector
		list
		forward List
		deque
		stack (adapter)
		queue (adapter)
		priority_queue (adapter)

	Associate:
		set
		multi-set
		map
		multi-map

	Unordered Associate:
		unordered_set
		unordered_map

Iterator:

Algorithm:

Function:
